-- The head of the definition describes the part before the `iff`,

-- must be 'simple'. This is not enforced syntactically, but with a
-- separate wf-check. A `Term` is simple if it is an expression that consists
-- of only a variable. A pattern is simple if it is precisely a pattern of
-- simple terms. Refer also to `isWfDefn` and to the following example.
