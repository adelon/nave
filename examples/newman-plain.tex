\begin{definition}
   Let $r$ be a relation on $A$.
   Let $t$ be the reflexive transitive closure of $r$.
   We say that $r$ is locally confluent if
   for all $a, b, c$ if $r(a, b)$ and $r(a, b)$,
   then there exists $d$ such that
   $t(b, d)$ and $t(c, d)$.

% Transitive closure is available as 'tc' from the Lean StdLib.
% Well-founded is available as 'well_founded'.
\begin{definition}
   Let $r$ be a relation on $A$.
   Let $t$ be the transitive closure of $r$.
   We say that $R$ is terminating if $t$ is well founded.

\begin{theorem}
   Let $A$ be a set.
   Let $r$ be a relation on $A$.
   If $r$ is well founded and $r$ is locally confluent,
   then $r$ is confluent.
