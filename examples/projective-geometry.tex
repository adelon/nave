\begin{theorem}[Irreflexive relation]
   Let $A$ be a set.
   A relation $\sim$ on $A$ is irreflexive when
   for every $x\in A$ it is not the case that $x \sim x$.
 \end{theorem}

 \begin{theorem}[Symmetric relation]
   Let $A$ be a set.
   A relation $\sim$ on $A$ is symmetric when
   % $\forall a, b: a\sim bÂ \implies b\sim a$.
   for every $x,y \in A$ we have that $x\sim y$ implies $y\sim x$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Cotransitive relation]
   Let $A$ be a set.
   A relation $\sim$ on $A$ is cotranstive when
   for every $x,y,z\in A$, if $x\sim y$ then $z\sim x$ or $z\sim y$.
 \end{theorem}

\begin{define-relation}[Apartness relation]
   Let $A$ be a set.
   An apartness relation on $A$ is a relation $\apart$ on $A$
   such that
   \begin{itemize}
      \item $\apart$ is irreflexive.
      \item $\apart$ is symmetric.
      \item $\apart$ is cotransitive.
   \end{itemize}

 \begin{theorem}[Incidence structure]
   An incidence structure consists of of
   \begin{itemize}
      \item a set $P$, called \textit{points}
      \item a set $L$, called \textit{lines}
      \item a relation $\incident$ between points and lines, called \textit{incidence relation}
   \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}


\begin{theorem}[Projective plane]
   The projective plane is an incidence structure $(P, L, \incident)$
   satisfying the following axioms:
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item ...
