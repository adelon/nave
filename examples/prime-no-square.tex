\begin{definition}
  A natural number $m$ is coprime to $n$ iff for all $d$ such that
  $d\divides m, n$, we have that $d = 1$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  A natural number $p$ is prime iff $p\neq 0,1$ and for every $k$
  such that $k\divides p$, we have $k = p$ or $k = 1$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Euclids lemma]
  If $p$ is prime and $p\divides m\mul n$
  then $p\divides m$ or $p\divides n$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
  For every rational number $q$ there exists $m, n$
  such that $m$ is coprime to $n$ and $q\mul m = n$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Prime no Square]
  Let $p$ be a prime natural number.
  There exists no rational number $q$
  such that $q\mul q = p$.
\end{theorem}
