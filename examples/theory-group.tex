\begin{theory}
   A semigroup is a set $A$
   equipped with $\mul : A\to A\to A$
   such that $\mul$ is associative.
\end{theory}


\begin{theory}
   An unital magma is a set $A$
   together with $\mul : A\to A\to A$,
   and $\unit : A$
   such that $\mul$ is associative
   and for all $a$ we have $\unit\mul a = a = a\mul\unit$.
\end{theory}

% Should induce the following in the type theoretical interpretation:
% * a predicate `isMagmaHom'
% * a type `MagmaHom' of all the functions satisfying `isMagmaHom'.

\begin{definition}
   Let $A$ be a magma.
   Let $B$ be a magma.
   Let $f : A\to B$.
   We say that $f$ is a magma homomorphism from $A$ to $B$ if
   for all $a, b$ we have $f(a\mul b) = f(a)\mul f(b)$.
\end{definition}


\begin{theorem}
   Let $A$ be a magma.
   Let $B$ be a magma.
   Let $C$ be a magma.
   Let $f$ be a magma homomorphism from $A$ to $B$.
   Let $g$ be a magma homomorphism from $B$ to $C$.
   Then $g\circ f$ is a magma homomorphism from $A$ to $B$.
\end{theorem}
