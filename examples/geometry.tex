   A geometry is a set $A$
   equipped with
   a ternary relation $\Betw$
   and a quaternary relation $\Cong$
   such that
   %
   % Free variables are implicitly universally quantified.
   \begin{axioms}
      \axiom[Reflexivity of equidistance]
         $\Cong(a,b,c,d)$.
      \axiom[Transitivity of equidistance]
         If $\Cong(a,b,p,q)$ and $\Cong(a,b,r,s)$,
         then $\Cong(p,q,r,s)$.
      \axiom[Identity of equidistance]
         If $\Cong(a,b,c,c)$, then $a = b$.
      \axiom[Segment extension]
         If $q\new a$, then there exists $x$
         such that $\StrictBetw(q,a,x)$ and $\Cong(a,x,b,c)$.
      \axiom[Five-segment]
         If $x\neq y$, $\Betw(x, y, z)$, $\Betw(p, q, r)$,
         $\Cong(x, y, p, q)$, $\Cong(y, z, q, r)$,
         $\Cong(x, u, x, v)$, and $\Cong(y, u, q, v)$,
         then $\Cong(z, u, r, v)$.
      \axiom[Identity of betweenness]
         It is not the case that $\Betw(a, b, a)$.
      \axiom[Inner Pasch] % Strict!
         If $\Betw(a, p, c)$, $\StrictBetw(b, q, c)$,
         and $\lnot\Col(a, b, c)$,
         then there exists $x$ such that
         $\Betw(p, x, b)$ and $\Betw(q, x, a)$.
   \end{axioms}
   where
   % TODO define strict in betweenness.
