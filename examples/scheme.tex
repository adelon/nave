\begin{structure}
   A scheme is a locally ringed space $X$ such that
   %there exists an open affine covering $U$ of $X$ such that
   $X$ admits a covering $(X_i)_{i âˆˆ I}$ such that
   for every $i$ there exists a ring $R$
   and an open immersion $f : \Spec{R}\to\structuresheaf{X}$ such that
   $\range{f} = X_i$ and $$
