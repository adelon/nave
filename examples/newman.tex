\begin{theory}
   A rewriting system is a set $A$
   together with a relation $\reduc$ on $A$.
\end{theory}


\begin{definition}
   Let $R$ be a rewriting system.
   We say that $a$ reduces to $b$ if $\reduc(a, b)$.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
   Let $R$ be a rewriting system.
   Let $t$ be the reflexive transitive closure of $\reduc$.
   We say that $R$ is confluent if
   for all $a, b, c$ if $\reduc(a, b)$ and $\reduc(a, b)$,
   then there exists $d$ such that
   $t(b, d)$ and $t(c, d)$.
\end{definition}


% Transitive closure is available as 'tc' from the Lean StdLib.
% Well-founded is available as 'well_founded'.
\begin{definition}
   Let $R$ be a rewriting system.
   Let $t$ be the transitive closure of $\reduc$.
   We say that $R$ is terminating if $t$ is well founded.
\end{definition}
